			<div class="story">
				<p>Hi, I'm Matthew. By day, I help people make web sites and apps accessible, with The Paciello Group. By night, I help make random other things accessible :-).</p>
				<p>This is a talk about landmark regions, a technique that can make your web pages much easier to navigate. You may've heard of landmarks before, but I wanted to step back and tell the story of how they came about, as this helps us to understand what they're for and how much they rock.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="full slide middle centre title">
			<p class="story">When navigating about the web, we often have two important questions in mind&hellip;</p>
			<h2 data-pause>
				<span>What's on the page?<br class="slides"></span>
				<span>How can I get there?</span>
			</h2>
			<p class="story">Several different ways to address these questions have been created over the years, probably the most fundamental and well-recognised being&hellip;</p>
		</div>

		<h2 class="full slide middle centre title">Headings</h2>

		<div class="slide full middle centre">
			<p class="story">In the beginning, websites used just headings, lists and links to give them structure. For example, the EROS (Extremely Reliable Operating System) home page has a simple layout with some paragraphs of text as its content, and headings, lists and links for navigation.</p>
			<img src="images/eros-os.png" alt="The EROS (Extremely Reliable Operating System) home page">
			<p class="story"><em>This verison of the EROS home page is actually from 2005, so its minimalism comes from being a proper Computer Sciencey site in the best tradition&mdash;and if you're into Operating System design, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EROS_(microkernel)">EROS</a> had many really interesting security and general design features.</em></p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide middle centre">
			<p class="story">People using a keyboard or screen reader could use a few keys to navigate&hellip;</p>

			<div class="slides" data-pause>
				<p class="slides key">&uarr;</p>
				<p class="slides key">&darr;</p>
				<p class="slides key wide">Tab</p>
			</div>
			<ul class="story">
				<li><p>The <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> key to scroll up, or announce the previous element.</p></li>
				<li><p>The <kbd>&darr;</kbd> key to scroll down, or announce the next element.</p></li>
				<li><p>The <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to move between interactive elements (links, buttons, form controls).</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p class="story">Screen readers provide additional shortcuts, such as <kbd>H</kbd> to skip to the next heading (and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> to skip back).</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide full middle centre">
			<p class="story">Screen reader users can also bring up a dialog listing the headings found on a page, and their levels, and navigate between them this way, too. You can move around the list in the dialog and choose to go straight to a specific heading.</p>
			<img src="images/eros-os-headings.png" alt="Screen reader dialog listing headings on the EROS OS home page">
			<p class="story">This sort of keyboard navigation is fundamental, works well and is still vital to exploring content, but&hellip;</p>
		</div>

		<div class="full slide middle centre title">
			<h2>Sites evolved</h2>
			<p class="story">The web has more capabilities and is more complex now, having evolved in different ways&hellip;</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide full middle centre">
			<p class="story">One way in which sites have evolved is in terms of visual design. For example, The Paciello Group's home page has simple content, but a spatial visual design that immediately communicates the structure of the page: it's clear that there's a main central section, which draws the visitor's attention, and some ancilliary information down at the bottom.</p>
			<img src="images/tpg.png" alt="The Paciello Group home page">
		</div>

		<div class="slide full middle centre">
			<p class="story">Content-focused pages may have a large volume of information on them. Here's the Wikipedia article on colour perception deficit, or colour-blindness, as an example&hellip;</p>
			<img src="images/wikipedia-article.png" alt="Overview of the Wikipedia article on colour perception deficit">
		</div>

		<div class="slide full middle centre">
			<p class="story">There are a lot of headings here, but they match the structure of the article, so are both helpful and necessary for fine-grained navigation around it.</p>
			<img src="images/wikipedia-article-headings.png" alt="Screen reader dialog showing some of the heading hierarchy for the Wikipedia article">
		</div>

		<div class="slide full middle centre">
			<p class="story">If we zoom into the top of the page, though, the visual design indicates that there are some actions that can be accomplished that are not just about reading the article&hellip;</p>
			<img src="images/wikipedia-article-cropped.png" alt="Zoomed view of the top of the Wikipedia article on colour perception deficit">
		</div>

		<div class="slide full middle centre">
			<p class="story">Actions that can be performed include&hellip;</p>
			<ul class="story">
				<li>Searching Wikipedia.</li>
				<li>Viewing the history or metadata around the article.</li>
				<li>Navigating about Wikipedia as a whole.</li>
			</ul>
			<img src="images/wikipedia-article-cropped-highlights.png" alt="Zoomed view of the top of the Wikipedia article, with highlighting around the regions of the page corresponding to the actions discussed">
		</div>

		<div class="slide full middle centre">
			<p class="story">We also use the web for different things, including highly interactive tasks such as online shopping.</p>
			<img src="images/shopping.png" alt="Online shopping site, showing a selection of apples">
			<p class="story">Headings can help us navigate here, but what if we wanted to move directly between the product search results and our shopping basket, for example?</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide full light">
			<p class="story">There are full-featured web-apps for other tasks too, such as communications suites, whose interfaces may include several different panes for folder navigation, contacts, message lists and content.</p>
			<p class="story">This screengrab happens to be of Google Wave. I really miss it; not so much the UI, but how elegantly it handled group communications. Anyway, the screengrab is somewhat low-res, so may seem blurry, which is interesting because if you can see the image, even though it's a bit blurry, you may still be able to discern the different areas of the UI quite quickly.</p>
			<img src="images/google-wave.png" alt="Google Wave communications web-app. I miss Google Wave!">
			<p class="story">The next innovation in navigation that I want to talk about helped alleviate several more of the challenges we've considered&hellip;</p>
		</div>

		<div class="full slide middle centre title">
			<h2>Skip links</h2>
			<p class="story">Skip links are links provided by the web author, placed by convention at the top of the page. Their purpose is to take you directly to the main content. Whilst you might want to explore any navigational content towards the start of the page on your first few visits, if you are familiar with the site, it can save a great deal of time to skip the navigation when it's not needed.</p>
			<p class="story">It's really important to consider that whilst it might not take long to <em>glance</em> at the navigational links, it could take you quite some time to read through them all&mdash;and that's exactly what a screen reader does.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide full middle centre">
			<p class="story">Here's a run-down of a skip link in use on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/get-inspired/47977024">a BBC Sports news story page</a>&hellip;</p>
			<p class="story">We begin at the top of the article's page, which features global and local navigation links, a sidebar and the start of the article's content.</p>
			<img src="images/bbc-marathon-1.png" alt="Stage 1, a BBC sport news article, which happens to be about fun facts relating to the London marathon.">
		</div>

		<div class="slide full middle centre">
			<p class="story">Upon the first press of the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, the skip link becomes visible.</p>
			<img src="images/bbc-marathon-2.png" alt="Stage 2, on the first press of the Tab key, the skip to content link is focused and made visible.">
		</div>

		<div class="slide full middle centre">
			<p class="story">Following the link moves the focus to the start of the article, missing out all the navigational links.</p>
			<img src="images/bbc-marathon-3.png" alt="Stage 3, activating the link takes the focus to the start of the article content, skipping over the navigational structures.">
		</div>

		<!-- TODO nested data-pause doesn't work -->
		<div class="slide centre middle">
			<h2>Skip links are awesome</h2>
			<div data-pause>
				<p>Easily discoverable<span class="story">&mdash;by convention they're always at the top of the page.</span></p>
				<p>Avoid repeated content</p>
				<p><strong>Save your visitors' time</strong><span class="story">&mdash;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/get-inspired/47977024">try reading through the navigation links with a screen reader</a>: they're all important and helpful, but someone who's familar with them and just wants to get to the article can save so much time by skipping them.</span></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<!-- TODO central, not centred -->
		<div class="slide centre middle">
			<h2>But</h2>
			<p class="story">Skip links do have some limitations; they're&hellip;</p>
			<div data-pause>
				<p>Only at the top (or where the author put them)<span class="story">&mdash;you can't access them from anywhere.</span></p>
				<p>Unable to give a full overview<span class="story"> of the content&mdash;they only let you skip over, or to, what the page author prescribed.</span></p>
				<p>Not quite so useful in app-like settings</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="full slide middle centre title">
			<p class="story">There is a solution to these problems, though, and that is of course&hellip;</p>
			<h2>Landmark regions</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="slide centre middle" data-pause>
			<p class="story">Landmark regions are&hellip;</p>
			<p>Signposts to broad areas of the page<span class="story">.</span></p>
			<p><strong>Non-visual</strong> complement to visual design<span class="story">&mdash;they don't change the appearance of a page; they let you impart the same structural information that the visual design does to people who may not be able to perceive it.</span></p>
			<p><strong>Random access</strong><span class="story">&mdash;you can move between landmarks wherever you are on the page.</span></p>
			<p>Part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/">W3C's Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA) standards</a><span class="story">. ARIA was created to help authors express, and browsers expose, the information that assistive technologies need to convey more complex user interfaces and interactions in web-apps. Support for ARIA, including landmark regions, across browsers and assistive technologies is mature.</span></p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide full centre middle">
			<p class="story">We can use landmarks to call out the areas of a page, for example here again is The Paciello Group home page we considered before.</p>
			<img src="images/tpg-signposts.png" alt="The Paciello Group home page with visually-apparent page areas called out in speech bubbles">
			<div class="story">
				<p>Looking at this page visually quickly gives you the impression that the main areas are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Navigation, which happens to be at the top.</li>
					<li>The &quot;main bit&quot;, in the middle.</li>
					<li>An area that's probably contact information and other stuff, at the bottom.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>That "other stuff" part is really key here&mdash;if you're a person who browses visually, you get all that info from just a glance, but if you can't see the screen at all, there's no such overview; you just have read through all of the content.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="slide full centre middle">
			<p class="story">How would a screen reader present this overview to your visitors? Well you can cycle through the regions on the page, or skip directly to the main region using a shortcut key, but you can also bring up a dialog in the same way as with headings&hellip;</p>
			<img src="images/tpg-landmarks-sr.png" alt="Landmark regions reported by a screen reader on The Paciello Group home page">
			<p class="story">As it happens, the landmark structure on TPG's home page includes a &quot;banner&quot; area that contains the logo as well as the &quot;navigation&quot; region with links; this is a fairly common structure. Also of note is that landmark regions, like headings, can have a tree-like structure, as they can be nested.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="full slide middle">
			<p class="story">But how does the screen reader get to know about these landmark regions on the page?</p>
			<ol data-pause>
				<li>Your <span class="story">content's </span>mark-up indicates the landmarks<span class="story">&mdash;they will often correspond to the areas called out by the page's visual design.</span></li>
				<li>The browser <span class="story">recognises and </span>exposes them<span class="story"> to&hellip;</span></li>
				<li>Assistive Technologies<span class="story">, which</span> present them<span class="story"> to the user, and provide keyboard navigation shortcuts too.</span></li>

		<div class="full slide middle centre title">
			<p class="story">As a page author, you may be asking&hellip;</p>

			<h2>How do I provide landmarks?</h2>
			<p class="story">The following examples show how to provide a landmark region for search functionality, the main content, footer and then other bits too.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Search box</h2>
			<p class="story">A conventional way to mark up a search UI is using a textbox, and a button labelled "Search", both wrapped in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element.</p>

				```html
				<div>
					<input type="text" ...>
					<button>Search</button>

				```
				--></div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Search box<span class="story"> with landmark</span></h2>
			<p class="story">A helpful landmark region can be added simply, by setting the <code>role</code> attribute on the container <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element to a value of "search".</p>
			<div data-markdown><!--
			```html
			<div role="search">
				<input type="text" ...>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Main content</h2>
			<p class="story"><a href="https://twitter.com/stevefaulkner">Steve Faulkner</a> did some research and found that there are some common ways people mark up the container of the page's main content. They may use a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with an <code>id</code> of "content".</p>

			<p class="story">What's the <code>aria-roledescription</code> attribute? It lets you override how a <code>role</code> is announced by screen readers. Let's imagine a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element with a role description of "Slartibartfast"&hellip;</p>

			<h2 class="story">Landmarks for everyone</h2>
			<p class="story">Now you know how to provide landmark regions in a really helpful way, and how they can be so clear and time-saving for people using screen readers. But surely landmarks could be helpful for everyone, so what about keyboard-only users?</p>
			<img src="images/piano-keyboard.jpg" alt="A piano keyboard (I couldn't find a nice picture of a computer keyboard)">
		</div>

		<div class="slide full">
			<p class="story">&hellip;and what about mouse users?</p>
			<img src="images/mouse.jpg" alt="A cute fluffy mouse">
		</div>

		<div class="slide full">
			<p class="story">There have been some long-running discussions with browser vendors on providing ways for people to explore the landmarks on the page, even without assistive technology. For example, there's a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=670928">Firefox bug</a> on the issue&hellip;</p>

		</div>

		<div class="full slide middle centre title">
			<p class="story">But also, is there a way that you, as a web developer, can check your site's landmark structure and experiment with improving on it? It'll be great if browsers do decide to implement all of the above (currently there are a number of questions that need to be answered, preferably through consensus in the industry, before that happens, but we're hopeful). For now, though, you can use the "Landmarks" browser extension&hellip;</p>

			<h2>Landmarks extension demo</h2>
			<div class="story">
				<p>This is a browser extension that I maintain that provides keyboard-only access to landmarks, and developer tools for inspecting and refining them. Let's check it out&hellip;</p>
				<p><em>At this point, the <a href="http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/landmarks/">Landmarks browser extension</a> would be demonstrated. The demo shows how to use it to navigate pages, and also, for developers, how to use the DevTools part of the extension to check how landmark regions are marked up, and add/edit them with updates reflected by the extension in real-time.</em></p>
				<p><em>Here's the outline for the demo&hellip;</em></p>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Visit the <a href="wow.html">demo World of Wombats page</a>.</em></li>
					<li><em>Check out the landmarks on the page, via the keyboard and the sidebar.</em></li>
					<li><em>Note that the two navigation regions are not differentiated.</em></li>
					<li><em>Open the Landmarks DevTools panel.</em></li>
					<li><em>Use it to observe how the <code>main</code> region is labelled.</em></li>
					<li><em>Add an <code>id</code> to the page title.</em></li>
					<li><em>Use the page title to label the first <code>navigation</code> region.</em></li>
					<li><em>Add a heading for the "On this page&hellip;" navigation links.</em></li>
					<li><em>Use the newly-added local heading to label the second <code>navigation</code> region.</em></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>

			<h2>Examples</h2>

					<a href="wow.html">World of Wombats (live demo version, not fully labelled)</a>
					<p class="story">This version of the page lacks some of the landmarks/labels that the &quot;full&quot; version below has, and is used to demonstrate the Landmarks browser extension.</p>
