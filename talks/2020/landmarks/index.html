				<p>Hi, I'm Matthew. By day, I help people make web sites and apps accessible, with The Paciello Group. By night, I help make random other things accessible :-).</p>
				<p>This is a talk about landmark regions, a technique that can make your web pages much easier to navigate. You may've heard of landmarks before, but I wanted to step back and tell the story of how they came about, as this helps us to understand what they're for and how much they rock.</p>
				<p><em>This version of the talk was presented at <a href="https://conf.a11yto.com/2020/">a11yTOConf 2020</a>. Previous versions were presented at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/London-Accessibility-Meetup/events/260754732/">Accessibility London</a> and <a href="https://www.roledrinks.com/in/amsterdam/2019-06-15.html">role=drinks</a>.

			<p class="story">When navigating about the web, we often have two important questions in mind&hellip;</p>
			<h2 data-pause>
				<span>What's on the page?<br class="slides"></span>
				<span>How can I get there?</span>
			</h2>
			<p class="story">Several different ways to address these questions have been created over the years, probably the most fundamental and well-recognised being&hellip;</p>
		</div>

		<h2 class="slide middle centre title">Headings</h2>

		<!-- TODO: without no-padding there's an overflow -->
		<div class="slide no-padding middle centre">
			<p class="story">In the beginning, websites used just headings, lists and links to give them structure. For example, the EROS (Extremely Reliable Operating System) home page has a simple layout with some paragraphs of text as its content, and headings, lists and links for navigation.</p>
			<img src="images/eros-os.png" alt="The EROS (Extremely Reliable Operating System) home page">
			<p class="story"><em>This version of the EROS home page is actually from 2005, so its minimalism comes from being a proper Computer Sciencey site in the best tradition&mdash;and if you're into Operating System design, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EROS_(microkernel)">EROS</a> had many really interesting security and general design features.</em></p>

				<li><p>The <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> key to scroll up, or announce the previous element.</p></li>
				<li><p>The <kbd>&darr;</kbd> key to scroll down, or announce the next element.</p></li>
				<li><p>The <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to move between interactive elements (links, buttons, form controls).</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p class="story">Screen readers provide additional shortcuts, such as <kbd>H</kbd> to skip to the next heading (and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> to skip back).</p>
		</div>

		<!-- TODO: without no-padding the image is really big -->
		<div class="slide no-padding middle centre">
			<p class="story">Screen reader users can also bring up a dialog listing the headings found on a page, and their levels, and navigate between them this way, too. You can move around the list in the dialog and choose to go straight to a specific heading.</p>

			<h2>Sites evolved</h2>

		</div>

		<!-- TODO: without no-padding the image is really big -->
		<div class="slide no-padding middle centre">
			<p class="story">One way in which sites have evolved is in terms of visual design. For example, The Paciello Group's home page has simple content, but a spatial visual design that immediately communicates the structure of the page: it's clear that there's a main central section, which draws the visitor's attention, and some ancilliary information down at the bottom.</p>

		<!-- TODO: without no-padding the image is really big -->

Anyway, the screengrab is somewhat low-res, so may seem blurry, which is interesting becuase if you can see the image, even though it's a bit blurry, you may still be able to discern the different areas of the UI quite quickly.</p>

		<div class="slide middle centre inverse">
			<h2>Skip links</h2>
			<p class="story">Skip links are links provided by the web author, placed by convention at the top of the page. Their purpose is to take you directly to the main content. Whilst you might want to explore any navigational content towards the start of the page on your first few visits, if you are familiar with the site, it can save a great deal of time to skip the navigation when it's not needed.</p>
			<p class="story">It's really important to consider that whilst it might not take long to <em>glance</em> at the navigational links, it could take you quite some time to read through them all&mdash;and that's exactly what a screen reader does.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- TODO: without no-padding the image is smaller than should be -->
		<div class="slide no-padding">
			<p class="story">Here's a run-down of a skip link in use on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/get-inspired/47977024">a BBC Sports news story page</a>&hellip;</p>

		<div class="slide middle centre inverse">
			<p class="story">There is a solution to these problems, though, and that is of course&hellip;</p>
			<h2>Landmark regions</h2>

			<p>Signposts to broad areas of the page<span class="story">.</span></p>
			<p><strong>Non-visual</strong> complement to visual design<span class="story">&mdash;they don't change the appearance of a page; they let you impart the same structural information that the visual design does to people who may not be able to perceive it.</span></p>
			<p><strong>Random access</strong><span class="story">&mdash;you can move between landmarks wherever you are on the page.</span></p>
			<p>Part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/">W3C's Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA) standards</a><span class="story">. ARIA was created to help authors express, and browsers expose, the information that assistive technologies need to convey more complex user interfaces and interactions in web-apps. Support for ARIA, including landmark regions, across browsers and assistive technologies is mature.</span></p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide no-padding">
			<p class="story">We can use landmarks to call out the areas of a page, for example here again is The Paciello Group home page we considered before.</p>
			<img src="images/tpg-signposts.png" alt="The Paciello Group home page with visually-apparent page areas called out in speech bubbles">
			<div class="story">
				<p>Looking at this page visually quickly gives you the impression that the main areas are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Navigation, which happens to be at the top.</li>
					<li>The &quot;main bit&quot;, in the middle.</li>
					<li>An area that's probably contact information and other stuff, at the bottom.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>That "other stuff" part is really key here&mdash;if you're a person who browses visually, you get all that info from just a glance, but if you can't see the screen at all, there's no such overview; you just have read through all of the content.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="slide no-padding">
			<p class="story">How would a screen reader present this overview to your visitors? Well you can cycle through the regions on the page, or skip directly to the main region using a shortcut key, but you can also bring up a dialog in the same way as with headings&hellip;</p>
			<img src="images/tpg-landmarks-sr.png" alt="Landmark regions reported by a screen reader on The Paciello Group home page">
			<p class="story">As it happens, the landmark structure on TPG's home page includes a &quot;banner&quot; area that contains the logo as well as the &quot;navigation&quot; region with links; this is a fairly common structure. Also of note is that landmark regions, like headings, can have a tree-like structure, as they can be nested.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide middle">
			<p class="story">But how does the screen reader get to know about these landmark regions on the page?</p>
			<ol data-pause>
				<li>Your <span class="story">content's </span>mark-up indicates the landmarks<span class="story">&mdash;they will often correspond to the areas called out by the page's visual design.</span></li>

		<div class="slide">

			<h2>Main content</h2>
			<p class="story"><a href="https://twitter.com/stevefaulkner">Steve Faulkner</a> did some research and found that there are some common ways people mark up the container of the page's main content. They may use a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with an <code>id</code> of "content".</p>

			<p class="story">Now you know how to provide landmark regions in a really helpful way, and how they can be so clear and time-saving for people using screen readers. But surely landmarks could be helpful for everyone, so what about keyboard-only users?</p>

		<div class="slide no-padding">
			<p class="story">There have been some long-running discussions with browser vendors on providing ways for people to explore the landmarks on the page, even without assistive technology. For example, there's a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=670928">Firefox bug</a> on the issue&hellip;</p>

		</div>

		<div class="slide middle centre inverse">
			<p class="story">But also, is there a way that you, as a web developer, can check your site's landmark structure and experiment with improving on it? It'll be great if browsers do decide to implement all of the above (currently there are a number of questions that need to be answered, preferably through consensus in the industry, before that happens, but we're hopeful). For now, though, you can use the "Landmarks" browser extension&hellip;</p>

			<h2>Landmarks extension demo</h2>
			<div class="story">
				<p>This is a browser extension that I maintain that provides keyboard-only access to landmarks, and developer tools for inspecting and refining them. Let's check it out&hellip;</p>
				<p><em>At this point, the <a href="http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/landmarks/">Landmarks browser extension</a> would be demonstrated. The demo shows how to use it to navigate pages, and also, for developers, how to use the DevTools part of the extension to check how landmark regions are marked up, and add/edit them with updates reflected by the extension in real-time.</em></p>
				<p><em>Here's the outline for the demo&hellip;</em></p>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Visit the <a href="wow.html">demo World of Wombats page</a>.</em></li>
					<li><em>Check out the landmarks on the page, via the keyboard and the sidebar.</em></li>
					<li><em>Note that the two navigation regions are not differentiated.</em></li>
					<li><em>Open the Landmarks DevTools panel.</em></li>
					<li><em>Use it to observe how the <code>main</code> region is labelled.</em></li>
					<li><em>Add an <code>id</code> to the page title.</em></li>
					<li><em>Use the page title to label the first <code>navigation</code> region.</em></li>
					<li><em>Add a heading for the "On this page&hellip;" navigation links.</em></li>
					<li><em>Use the newly-added local heading to label the second <code>navigation</code> region.</em></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
