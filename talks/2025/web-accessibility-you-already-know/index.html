	<div class="slide centre middle">

		How do we make things accessible?
	</h3>

	<div class="slide middle centre">
		<p>Don't make them inaccessible.</p>
		<p class=story>It sounds flippant, but there's a lot of truth in this advice&mdash;the web platform gives us many
			ways to easily ensure that our content <em>is</em> accessible, for example:</p>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle centre">
		<p class=story>Providing labels for buttons:</p>
		<code>&lt;button&gt;<mark>Send</mark>&lt;/button&gt;</code>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle">
		<p class=story>Associating labels with input controls:</p>
		<pre><code>&lt;label for="<mark>pass</mark>"&gt;<mark>Password:</mark>&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input  id="<mark>pass</mark>" type="password"&gt;</code></pre>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle centre">
		<p class=story>Providing a heading hierarchy:</p>
		<p><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></p>
		<p><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code></p>
		<p><code>&lt;h3&gt;</code></p>
		<p><code>&hellip;</code></p>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle centre">
		<p class=story>Indicating the nature of the regions of the page (we'll talk a bit more about the accessibility
			benefits of these elements towards the end of the presentation):</p>
		<p><code>&lt;main&gt;</code></p>

		<p><code>&hellip;</code></p>
	</div>

	<h3 class="slide middle centre hyowger">
		<span class=story>But what makes these standard elements accessible</span>?

	<div class="slide middle centre">
		<p><span class=story>&hellip;and what if you want to make your own custom element, a

	<div class="slide middle centre">
		<div class=story>
			<p>One primary example of things you can't do (yet) with standard HTML is putting images inside of a
				<code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element. This is a common ask from developers, but requires a custom element,
				because the standard one doesn't provide this functionality.
			</p>
			<p>Well the good news is that the Open UI project is working on making things like this a reality&mdash;check out

		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle position-centre">

			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle centre">
		<p class=story>For detailed information on <em>how</em> to actually do this, consult the WCAG Quick Reference (which

			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p class=story>But again, how come following these guidelines actually <em>works</em>? We'll expand upon this later,
			but to start understanding this, we need
			to consider how web content is usually delivered to the user. We can think of a simple flow of content, from the
			server to the user, via the browser:</p>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle centre horizontal no-padding" data-split data-pause>
		<p>Content</p>
		<p>Browser<br class="slides">(User Agent)</p>
		<p>User</p>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle centre horizontal no-padding" data-split data-pause>
		<p class=story>When someone's using an assistive technology, then conceptually we can see it as part of the browser.
			The browser <em>exposes</em> certain relevant info to the assistive technology, which then <em>renders</em> that
			info in an appropriate way for the user.</p>
		<p>Content</p>
		<p>Browser<br class="slides">(User Agent)</p>
		<p>Assistive technology (AT)</p>
		<p>User</p>

		<div class=story>
			<p>In addition, the user may provide input to the web app/content <em>via</em> the assistive technology
				(e.g. via speech recognition, instead of typing). In this case, the web app/content still recieves the input it
				was expecting (e.g. text) in a standard way, via OS APIs, and the standard textbox control and events in the
				browser, and doesn't (and ideally <em>shouldn't</em>) know how the text was input.</p>
			<p>So, how does this exposing of info actually work? Where does the info come from, and how can we understand, and
				debug it?</p>

	<h3 class="slide middle centre">The accessibility tree</h3>

	<div class="slide middle centre">
		<div class=story>
			<p>Let's consider a simple page, with a figure and a button. The figure has some alternative text, and the button might, in some frameworks, end up being wrapped in multiple layers of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s, creating the infamous &quot;<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> soup&quot; effect. If you inspect this page in the DevTools DOM panel, you get a representation of the living DOM tree in memory. It looks like HTML, but it's live and you (and your scripts) can do anything with it.</p>
			<p>But what sort of info is important to assistive technologies? Definitely similar stuff: the order or structure; some of the types of elements (the semantic ones); and things like content alternatives for images, for example. Some other stuff isn't so important&mdash;the semantically-neutral <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> soup could be losslessly stripped out, for example.</p>
			<p>If you activate the accessibility tree view in the DevTools, you'll find something similar to the DOM, but pared back in some ways (and maybe quite detailed in others). The accessibility tree provides the subset of the DOM tree that is relevant to assistive technologies, and it is the thing that assistive technologies can query in order to do their job of both presenting the content in the appropriate way for the user, and in some cases to help the user navigate about the page.</p>

	<h3 class="slide middle centre">Objects &amp; properties</h3>

	<!-- FIXME data-pause on slide includes a stop for the story-mode element; oops. -->
	<div class="slide middle centre">
		<p class=story>When the browser loads the page into memory, and creates the Document Object Model (DOM) tree, it
			brings each HTML element to life&mdash;perhaps as some kind of content, or perhaps as an interactive control. The
			&quot;living&quot; DOM tree elements (or even some parts of them) can be thought of as objects. Depending on the
			source element, the corresponding DOM tree node object may have a number of different properties. For example, an
			image has a source, and an anchor (link)
			has a
			destination.
		<p>
		<div data-pause>
			<p><code>&lt;a <mark>href</mark>="&hellip;"&gt;<mark>ACME Home Page</mark>&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
			<p><code>&lt;img <mark>src</mark>="&hellip;" <mark>alt</mark>="ACME"&gt</code></p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle position-centre" data-pause>
		<p class=story>From an accessibility perspective, the important properties that any element may have are:</p>
		<dl class=properties data-pause>
			<dt><strong>Name</strong></dt>
			<dd>what's it called?</dd>
			<dt><strong>Description</strong></dt>
			<dd>ancillary info</dd>
			<dt><strong>Role</strong></dt>
			<dd>what does it do?</dd>
			<dt><strong>State</strong></dt>
			<dd>what's been done to it?</dd>
			<dt><strong>Value</strong></dt>
			<dd>input from the user</dd>
		</dl>
		<p class=story>We'll explore some examples of these next. Not every type of property is applicable to every type of
			element. Also, in some cases, the way to make something accessible is actually to provide a different,
			alternative, version of it&mdash;we'll see an example of this, too. Also, for simplicity, we'll discount some
			elements have a standard <code>disabled</code> property set, as this is one you have probably come across
			before&mdash;but it, too, does have an impact on accessibility and usability, because if an element is
			<code>disabled</code>, it is not possible to interact with it.

		<p><span class=story>The above examples pratically demonstrate why the best practices, that you already follow, and that we discussed earlier actually work: </span><strong>Standard HTML elements expose these properties for you.</strong></p>
		<p data-pause><span>Though sometimes you need to provide appropriate attribute <strong>values</strong>, <span>or
					<strong>alternative
						content</strong><span class=story>, you get all the accessibility info exposed, and all the keyboard, touch, and any other input handling, for free with standard HTML elements</span>.</span></span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle centre" data-pause>
		<p><span class=story>The converse is also true. </span>If you're making <strong>custom widgets</strong>, you need to <strong>provide all of this
				information&hellip;</strong></p>
		<p><strong>&hellip;and the behaviour&hellip;</strong></p>
		<p><strong>&hellip;(including keyboard handling)&hellip;</strong></p>
		<p><strong>&hellip;and the styling!</strong></p>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle centre" data-pause>
		<p class=story>You can ensure the correct information is exposed via the following attributes.</p>
		<p><code>role</code></p>
		<p><code>aria-</code>*</p>
		<p>
			<span class=story>You may've seen these attributes before. They come from a W3C specification called</span>
			<span class="bottom"><strong>A</strong>ccessible <strong>R</strong>ich</span>
			<br class="slides">
			<span class="top"><strong>I</strong>nternet <strong>A</strong>pplications</span><span class=story>. This gives you
				the mechanism for providing these important properties to elements that don't automatically expose them, and
				explains the rules around doing so.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle centre">
		<p class=story>The ARIA spec can be challenging to dive in to, as it's meant for both browser engine implementors as
			well as developers. You can find some clear, practical examples across a range of widget types in the ARIA
			Authoring Practices Guide (APG).</p>

		<figure>
			<img class="padded" src="images/aria-apg.jpeg" alt="ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) home page">

				<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/">https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/</a>
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p class=story>However it's vital to understand that all the ARIA markup does is expose the <em>accessibility
				info</em>&mdash;it doesn't
			affect the behaviour or styling&mdash;that's still all down to you.</p>
	</div>

	<h3 class="slide middle centre">Order of precedence</h3>

	<div class="slide middle centre">
		<div class=story>
			<p>Orders of precedence come up a lot in computing, and you have most likely come accross them before. The next example shows how we might improve the labelling of buttons in a table, and also demonstrates the effect of the order of precedence we use to calculate an element's accessible name.</p>
			<p>This table represents a shopping basket with some items in it. The buttons at the end of each row are for deleting that item from the basket. They are standard HTML button elements, labelled by a unicode &quot;wastebasket&quot; character&mdash;which is announced correctly as &quot;wastebasket&quote; by screen readers. Also, if you <kbd>Tab</kbd> around the table, moving between rows will cause most screen readers to announce the row header (if semantically provided) before the name of the button, so you'd hear something like &quot;Pineapple Wastebasket button&quot; and &quot;Ironing board Wastebasket button&quot; as you <kbd>Tab</kbd> into and through the table.</p>
		</div>
		<figure class="example">
			<figcaption>
				<p>Example 3</p>
			</figcaption>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Item</th>
						<th>Quantity</th>
						<th>Price</th>
						<th></th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th id="item-1">Pineapple</th>
						<td>42</td>
						<td>£111.30</td>

					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</figure>
		<div class=story>
			<p>This behaviour is quite helpful already, but we can improve it. One way that people using screen readers navigate is to bring up a list of controls, such as a list of buttons, on the page. In this case, having the buttons labelled just &quot;wastebasket&quot; isn't very helpful. Also the idea of a bin meaning &quot;delete&quot; may be clear to some, but it's quite a visual metaphor, and may not be clear to everyone (visually-browsing or otherwise).</p>
			<p>So the first thing we could do is to inspect the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements, and see indeed that their accessible names come from their contents: the Unicode &quot;wastebasket&quot; character.</p>
			<p>We could then override this by supplying each <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element with an <code>aria-label="Remove"</code> attribute that gives it an invisible accessible name of &quot;Remove&quot;, which would be announced by a screen reader. In fact, if you inspect the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> now, you will see that the previous name (the wastebasket character) has been superceded by the <code>aria-label</code> value. This is becuase <code>aria-label</code> has higher precedence in the accessible name calculation than the contents of the element.</p>
			<p>But we've just made the names clearer&mdash;we've not solved the ambiguity problem: they're all just going to be called &quot;Remove&quot; now instead.</p>
			<p>We can solve this by employing two neat tricks; one of which we just used:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>We can override the accessible name of the button again, by using the highest-precedence <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute&mdash;which takes the IDs of the elements whose contents should form our buttons' accessible names, rather than a text string that directly <em>is</em> intended to be the accessible name.</p></li>
				<li><p>We can make that <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute value self-referencing&mdash;so it uses the button's current name (from its existing <code>aria-label</code> attribute <em>in conjunction with the table's row header</em>).</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sounds complicated, but it's as simple as just adding another attribute to the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element: <code>aria-labelledby="remove-1 item-1"</code> for example. Check it out and you'll see the effect in the accessibility inspector, and in a screen reader. Voilà: bringing up a list of buttons (if you do the same thing to the other one!) will clearly show which button does what.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle centre">
		<div class=story>
			<p>We can now understand what was going wonky in the first example, where the visually-apparent &quot;Log in&quot; button was being announced as &quot;Sign in&quot;: this was becuase an <code>aria-label</code> attribute had been set to override the text within the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element. You might think this is a contrived example&mdash;and, technically, this one is, because I made it on purpose&mdash;but this sort of thing happens <em>loads</em> in the wild; partly becuase many frameworks get a bit over-the-top about setting attributes like <code>aria-label</code>.</p>
		</div>
		<figure class="example">
			<figcaption>
				<p>Example 1b</p>
			</figcaption>
			<div class="gird22">
				<label for="user-1bx">Username:</label>
				<input id="user-1bx">
				<label for="pass-1bx">Password:</label>
				<input id="pass-1bx" type="password">
			</div>
			<p class="right"><button aria-label="Sign in">Log in</button></p>
		</figure>
		<div class=story>
			<p>Frameworks do this in an effort to be helpful, no doubt, but as the saying goes: &quot;ot of sight, out of mind&quot; and this is especially true if you're not aware that your framework is doing this, nor the huge impact doing this could have if&mdash;or rather when, inevitably&mdash;the two competing &quot;labels&quot; go out of synch.</p>
			<p>This is why it's such good practice to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Try to keep all important text visible on the page, for everyone. Don't make things <em>just</em> for people you think are using some sort of assistive technology (quite often this leads to wrong assumptions of all kinds, as helpfully as it may be intended).</p></li>
				<li><p>If you <em>must</em> provide an invisible accessible name, like in the table example above, which referenced the row header: again, try to use <code>aria-labelledby</code> to ensure that the association is made to another <em>visible</em> element on the page, to avoid repetition, and synchronisation issues in future. Or, at the least, be sure that your framework or back-end code is architected in a clean, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">&quot;don't repeat yourself&quot;</a> manner.</p></li>

	<h2 class="slide middle centre">3. Practical tools</h2>

	<div class="slide middle centre hyowger">
		<p class=story>We've already been using a hugely important one: your browser's DevTools. You'll already be familiar
			with them, but perhaps you've now seen some parts of them that you have not used much before. Whilst the DevTools
			are extremely helpful, there are some more fundamental tools you probably have, and you've probably already done
			some accessibility inspection with them, without knowing it&hellip;</p>
		<span class=slides>🐁</span>
		<div class=story>
			<h3>The mouse</h3>
			<p>You can do a lot of casual debugging, as we've seen, with the mouse.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle">
		<p class=story>Here we see an example of the sort of info in a pop-up that you can get when using the DevTools inspector, and hovering over an element. You can get information on the element's role, state, and other interactivity properties and even the contrast ratio between text foreground and background.</p>
		<img src="images/inspector-hover.png"
			alt="Screengrab of a DevTools pop-up that appears over an element when inspecting it in the page, via the mouse. The pop-up shows us info about the element such as its name and role, and contrast ratio (and whether this is WCAG-compliant or not).">
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle">
		<div class=story>
			<p>Also, you can do some spot-checking that can tell you if a visually apparent label is likely associated with a form control. As we discussed before, you know it's best practice to use a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element, and make the association semantically. That causes the accessible name of the form control to be set for you. It also makes the visible label act as a larger click, or touch, area for toggling checkboxes, or focusing textboxes. This makes it a lot easier for many of us to use.</p>
			<p>In the example below, the same visually-apparent label is present next to each checkbox, but the second one is correctly associated in this way.</p>
		</div>
		<figure class="example">
			<figcaption>
				<p>Example 4</p>
			</figcaption>
			<div class=centre>
				<p><input type=checkbox> Agree to terms and conditions</p>
				<p><label><input type=checkbox> Agree to terms and conditions</label></p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<div class=story>
			<p>Now, it's true that the techniques for manually providing accessibility info that we've discussed <em>could</em> be used in both of these examples to counter-intuitive effects&hellip;</p>
			<p>It's possible to use an <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute to link the non-<code>&lt;label&gt;</code> visible text programmatically to the first checkbox&mdash;but whilst that <em>would</em> give the first checkbox a suitable accessible name, it wouldn't bring the advantage of the larger click/touch target.</p>
			<p>It's also possible to take the second, correctly-associated example, and explicitly set an <code>aria-label</code> attribute on the checkbox&mdash;that would override the accessible name, so it may no longer match the visible <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>, but the larger click/touch target behaviour would be preserved.</p>
			<p>Both of those cases demonstrate the need for more than just spot checks, but you can get a good impression of the level of consideration of accessibility that went into a site or app by making checks like this.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle centre hyowger">
		<span class=slides>⌨️</span>
		<div class=story>
			<h4>The keyboard</h4>
			<p>This is where it gets interesting; you can oftne highlight a wide range of accessibility barriers posed by a
				site or app by interacting with it via the keyboard. This is because a lot of assistive technologies (the interaction side of them, at least) either emulate, or <em>are</em> some kind of keyboard (e.g. for inputting text that was recognised from the user's speech).</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="slide middle centre">
		<p class=story>In this example, a thing that looks like a button is provided in between the text box and the link, but it only looks like a button when you use the mouse: if you use the keyboard, you find that it's not really a button at all!</p>
		<figure class="example">
			<figcaption>
				<p>Example 5</p>
			</figcaption>
			<!-- TODO: w/o br, input is on separate line in non-fullscreen mode -->
			<!-- TODO: Why does .centre here not get moved up, but does on the <figure>? -->
			<div class="centre">
				<p><label>Email address:<br><input type="text"></label></p>
				<p><span class="custom-btn">Sign in with access code</span></p>
				<p><a href="javascript:void;">Terms and conditions</a></p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p class=story>Another way that using the keyboard can help you find accessibility barriers is that it can highlight (maybe that's the wrong word) situations in which your focus indication is poor or lacking. Try using a site or app with the keyboard alone, and see if you can always be clear as to &quot;where you are&quot; on the page.</p>
	</div>

	<h2 class="slide middle centre">Browser limitations</h2>

	<div class="slide middle centre" data-pause>
		<div class=story>
			<p>The DevTools are awesome, but there are some things browsers don't show you&mdash;or at least don't show you in
				much detail (yet).</p>
			<p>For example,
				there are a set of HTML elements that automatically create invisible regions of the page, called
				&quot;landmark
				regions&quot;. These landmarks provide a broad overview of the content on the page, and thus can be really
				helpful for
				people using assistive technologies, because they can help users do things like skip over the navigation links,
				straight to the main content, or otherwise quickly access the part of the page they're after. Check out my <a
					href="https://matatk.agrip.org.uk/talks/2020/landmarks/">a11yTO talk on Landmarks</a> for more info. Anyway,
				those elements are:</p>
		</div>

		<ul class=no-number>
			<li><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></li>
			<li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></li>
			<li><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></li>
			<li><code>&lt;main&gt;</code></li>
			<li><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></li>
			<li><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></li>
		</ul>

		<div class=story>
			<p>Whilst DevTools does show you the role that an element is exposing, there's currently no way to highlight
				landmarks visually (for debugging), nor is there a way to bring up a tree of landmarks on the page. Such
				debugging tools would be helpful, because some elements only form landmark regions if they're given accessible
				names, or in other circumstances.</p>
			<p>It's also of note that browsers don't currently expose landmark regions to keyboard users who are <em>not</em>
				using some sort of assistive technology, which would also be pretty cool, but that's outside the scope of
				DevTools.</p>
			<p>To acheive all of the above today, you can use extensions&mdash;which could become part of the browser, as well
				as part of the DevTools, in future.

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>As a designer, think about the heading hierarchy and landmark structure of your pages.</p>

				<li>
					<p>Also think about what the keyboard interaction would be with any interactive widget.</p>
